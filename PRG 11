11. Write a program to count frequency of characters in a given file
def char_frequency(str1):
 dict={}
 for n in str1:
 keys=dict.keys()
 if n in keys:
 dict[n]+=1
 else:
 dict[n]=1
 return dict
str=input("Enter file name to read from :")
getfile= open(str).read()
D=char_frequency(getfile)
print("the frequency of each character in the file")
for k,v in D.items():
 print(k,v)
Note:create text document in the same folder where your lab program is saved
Output:
Enter file name to read from :hello.txt
