5. Write a program to create a menu with the following options
 1. TO PERFORM ADDITION 2. TO PERFORM SUBTRACTION
3. TO PERFORM MULTIPLICATION 4. TO PERFORM DIVISION 
def add(n1,n2): 
 return n1+n2 
def sub(n1,n2): 
 return n1-n2 
def mul(n1,n2): 
 return n1*n2 
def div(n1,n2): 
 return n1/n2 
print("Welcome to the Arithmetic Program") 
choice =1 
while(choice!=0): 
 x = int(input(" Enter the first number\n")) 
 y = int(input(" Enter the second number\n")) 
 print("1. TO PERFORM ADDITION") 
 print("2. TO PERFORM SUBTRACTION") 
 print("3. TO PERFORM MULTIPLICATION") 
 print("4. TO PERFORM DIVISION") 
 print("0. To Exit") 
 choice = int(input("Enter your choice")) 
 if choice == 1:
 print(x, "+" ,y ,"=" ,add(x,y)) 
 elif choice == 2: 
 print(x, "-" ,y ,"=" ,sub(x,y)) 
 elif choice == 3: 
 print(x, "*" ,y ,"=" ,mul(x,y)) 
 elif choice == 4: 
 print(x, "%" ,y ,"=" ,div(x,y)) 
 elif choice ==0: 
 print("Exit") 
 else: print("Invalid Choice");
Output:
