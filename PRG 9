9. Write a python program to add some days to your present date and print 
the date added.
from datetime import timedelta 
from datetime import date 
# taking input as the current date 
# today() method is supported by date 
# class in datetime module 
Begindatestring = date.today() 
# print begin date print("Beginning date") 
print(Begindatestring) 
# calculating end date by adding days 
days= int(input("how many days to add? "))
Enddate = Begindatestring + timedelta(days) 
# printing end date print("Ending date") 
print(Enddate)
output:
2023-09-09
how many days to add? 10
